# ✅ Dashboard Update: Menu Analysis Live!

I have successfully updated your dashboard with the new features:

1.  **Tab 3: Menu Analysis** - Uses the specific item files you found!
    *   **Top 10 Items:** See what sells best by Revenue and Qty.
    *   **Least Sold Items:** See exactly what isn't moving.
    *   **Category Performance:** Breakdown by Waffles, Shakes, etc.

2.  **Organized 5-Tab Layout:**
    *   Overview
    *   Weekly Trends
    *   Menu Analysis **(NEW)**
    *   Dispatch & Channels
    *   Hourly Patterns

You can reload your dashboard (localhost) to see it right now! It automatically uses the `most_sold_items.csv` and `least_sold_items.csv` files you pointed out. 🚀
